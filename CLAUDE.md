## 🚨 STOP - READ THIS FIRST

**All assistant guidance has been moved to [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).**

Before doing ANYTHING, read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for:
- Critical rules you MUST NEVER violate
- Project overview and structure
- Code style requirements
- Development workflows
- T3 Stack patterns (tRPC, Zustand, Drizzle)

**Do not proceed without reading [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) first.**
